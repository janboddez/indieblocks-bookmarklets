# IndieBlocks Bookmarklets
Bookmarklets support for IndieBlocks.

Install and activate. Visit “Tools > IndieBlocks Bookmarklets” for draggable, well, bookmarklets. These currently assume you have both post types (i.e., notes and likes) enabled.

Tweak as needed. (E.g., update the `post_type` query argument to better suit your setup.)

Selected text is sanitized—use at your own risk, though!—and then copied into the relevant block’s inner blocks.
