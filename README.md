# IndieBlocks Bookmarklets
Bookmarklets support for IndieBlocks.

Install and activate. Visit “Tools > IndieBlocks Bookmarklets” for draggable, well, bookmarklets. These currently assume you have both post types (i.e., notes and likes) enabled.

Tweak as needed.

Selected text is sanitized—use at your own risk, though!—and then copied into the relevant block’s inner blocks.
